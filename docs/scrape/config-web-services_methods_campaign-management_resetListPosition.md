## resetListPosition

Resets to the beginning the dialing lists position of an outbound campaign. By default, the dialer attempts to dial all the records in campaign lists before restarting. In some cases, you may need to start dialing from the beginning of the lists. To do so, use the resetListPosition method to reset campaign lists position to the first record in the dialing lists, based on the record order at list upload.
